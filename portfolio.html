                                        The project also applied <strong>IAS 2</strong> to identify the costs of purchase and conversion involved
                                        in producing Smith's chocolate bars. You provided four clear examples of these costs and how they are
                                        accounted for under the standard.

                            My group and I presented the project in the form of a <strong>report</strong> and a <strong>10-minute presentation</strong>,
                            as required by the given case study(above). The report covered our digital strategy, risk analysis, and recommendations for
                            employee training and inventory cost management, while the presentation used slides and visual aids to engage the marker.
                            This project demonstrates my ability to apply digital transformation strategies to real-world business problems, showing how
                            AI and other technologies can drive value in traditional industries.
